Olist is the largest department store in Brazil. The 8 datasets provided by Olist include the information of 100k orders (an order might have multiple items) from 2016 to 2018 made in Brazil, enabling viewing an order from multiple perspectives: order status, price, customer location, product attributes, geolocation, and reviews by customers. The data has been anonymized to protect privacy and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses. Some of the text in the data is in Portuguese, hope this wonâ€™t discourage you from choosing it for this project. The data is divided into multiple datasets for better understanding and organization:

No specific problems are defined be answered, and we are encouraged to perform comprehensive data analysis on any problem we would like to explore. It is not required to use every piece of information provided. For the data analysis, applying some of the methods learned in class is required, and other methods or software not covered are also encouraged. Make presentation slides, record a presentation video, and write a project report to present data analysis and results.

`PPT.pdf` is the PPT we used for presentation. `Report.pdf` is the report ( The $\rm{4^{th}}$ section $\textbf{Customers}$ is written by me.)

The foulder `OlistData` contains the whole 8 datasets.

The R and Python notebook files are codes and csv files are data I used during data analysis.
