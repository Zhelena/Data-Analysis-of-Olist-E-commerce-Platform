Olist is the largest department store in Brazil. The 8 datasets provided by Olist include the information of 100k orders (an order might have multiple items) from 2016 to 2018 made in Brazil, enabling viewing an order from multiple perspectives: order 
status, price, customer location, product attributes, geolocation, and reviews by customers. The data has been anonymized to protect privacy and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses. Some of the text in the data 
is in Portuguese, hope this wonâ€™t discourage you from choosing it for this project. The data is divided into multiple datasets for better understanding and organization:
